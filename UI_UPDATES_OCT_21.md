## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Hide Sign In Button
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (Line 179-180)
- Commented out the `<AuthButton />` component in the header
- Button is no longer visible to users
- Structure preserved for easy re-enabling if needed

### 2. ✅ Hide Leaderboard Section
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (Line 333-336)
- Commented out the entire Leaderboard component
- Leaderboard functionality remains intact but hidden from UI
- Can be re-enabled easily in the future

### 3. ✅ Move "Choose Your Judge" Before "Tone Control"
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (Line 219-228)
- Reordered components in the input form
- New order:
  1. Idea Input
  2. Project Name Input
  3. File Upload
  4. **Judge Selection** ← Moved up
  5. **Tone Matrix** ← Moved down
  6. Submit Button

**Rationale:** Judge selection is now more prominent and appears earlier in the user flow.

### 4. ✅ Move "Play Voice Roast" Button Between Roast and Feedback
**File:** `src/components/JudgeCard.tsx` (Line 120-123)
- Repositioned VoicePlayer component between "The Roast" and "Constructive Feedback" sections
- Added center alignment with flex justify-center
- Added vertical spacing (my-6) for better visual separation

**Before:**
```
[Scores]
[Roast]
[Feedback]
[Voice Player]
```

**After:**
```
[Scores]
[Roast]
[Voice Player] ← Centered
[Feedback]
```

### 5. ✅ Display All Final Verdicts with Highlight
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (Line 284-315)
- Changed from single verdict display to three-option display
- All three verdicts (PASS, MAYBE, FAIL) are now always visible
- The actual verdict is highlighted with:
  - Larger scale (scale-110)
  - Full opacity
  - Animated pulse effect
  - Spotlight glow effect
- Non-selected verdicts are:
  - Dimmed (opacity-50)
  - Smaller scale (scale-90)
  - Lower opacity colors

**Visual Effect:**
```
[PASS] [MAYBE] [FAIL]
  ✓      dim     dim   ← If result is PASS
```
