# üéØ Next Steps - Judge & Tone Matrix Update

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete!

All code changes from `Set_up_19_Oct.md` have been successfully implemented. The application is ready for deployment.

## üìã What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Configure Voice IDs in Vercel (REQUIRED)

Before deploying, you MUST configure 5 new environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **roastmyidea**
3. Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
4. Add these 5 new variables:

```
VOICE_ID_TECH_BRO=<your-elevenlabs-voice-id>
VOICE_ID_BRUTAL_VC=<your-elevenlabs-voice-id>
VOICE_ID_SUPPORTIVE_COMEDIAN=<your-elevenlabs-voice-id>
VOICE_ID_ZEN_MENTOR=<your-elevenlabs-voice-id>
VOICE_ID_CEO=<your-elevenlabs-voice-id>
```

**How to get voice IDs:** See `ENV_SETUP_JUDGE_UPDATE.md` for detailed instructions.

**Optional:** Set `ENABLE_MULTI_JUDGE=false` (or simply don't include it)

### Step 2: Deploy to Preview Branch

```bash
# Create preview branch
git checkout -b deploy/judge-update

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: implement single judge selection with updated personas and tone matrix fixes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin deploy/judge-update
```

This will automatically trigger a Vercel preview deployment.

### Step 3: Test Preview Deployment

Once preview is live, test these critical features:

**Quick Test Checklist:**
- [ ] 5 judge buttons appear on homepage
- [ ] Clicking each judge changes selection
- [ ] Tone matrix labels are on edges (not corners)
- [ ] Dragging to top shows "Sarcastic", bottom shows "Supportive"
- [ ] No percentages displayed under tone matrix
- [ ] Submit a roast with each judge (test at least 2-3)
- [ ] Verify responses focus on judge's expertise
- [ ] Test voice playback (if voice IDs configured)

**Detailed test plan:** See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_JUDGE_UPDATE.md`

### Step 4: Merge to Production

Once preview tests pass:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge preview branch
git merge deploy/judge-update

# Push to production
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy to production.

### Step 5: Monitor Production

For the first 24 hours:
- Check Vercel logs for errors
- Test all 5 judges in production
- Verify leaderboard updates correctly
- Monitor API usage (Gemini, ElevenLabs)

## üìÅ Important Documents

**Before Deployment:**
1. `ENV_SETUP_JUDGE_UPDATE.md` - How to configure voice IDs
2. `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_JUDGE_UPDATE.md` - Complete testing checklist

**Reference:**
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_JUDGE_UPDATE.md` - What was changed
4. `Set_up_19_Oct.md` - Original requirements (all met ‚úÖ)

## üé® What Changed (User-Visible)

### New Judge Selection UI
- Users now see 5 judge buttons before submitting
- Each judge has clear expertise description
- Random judge selected by default
- Single judge response (no more multi-judge)

### Improved Tone Matrix
- Labels centered on edges (clearer axis meaning)
- Fixed direction: Top = Sarcastic, Bottom = Supportive
- Quadrant dividers for better visual guidance
- Descriptive labels instead of confusing percentages

### Better Judge Responses
- Each judge focuses on their area of expertise:
  - **Tech Bro 3000:** Technical aspects
  - **Brutal VC:** Investment & valuation
  - **Supportive Comedian:** Creative & UX
  - **Zen Mentor:** Customer experience
  - **Middle-Aged CEO:** Business viability
- Tone parameters better reflected in responses
- More consistent expertise-focused feedback

## üîß Technical Changes

**Modified Files:**
- `src/lib/constants.ts` - Updated judge names & expertise
- `src/components/JudgeSelector.tsx` - NEW judge selection UI
- `src/components/ToneMatrix.tsx` - Fixed UI/UX issues
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Integrated judge selection
- `src/app/api/roast/route.ts` - Single judge mode
- `src/lib/gemini.ts` - Enhanced prompts

**New Test Files:**
- `tests/unit/judge-selection.test.js`
- `tests/unit/tone-matrix.test.js`
- `tests/integration/gemini-prompt.test.js`
- `tests/integration/roast-api.test.js`

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Compilation successful, no errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
1. **Judge names changed** - Old judge names no longer used
2. **Must select judge** - Required step before roasting
3. **Voice IDs required** - Must configure 5 new environment variables

### Database
- ‚úÖ No schema changes needed
- ‚úÖ Old roasts still readable
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard continues to work

### Backward Compatibility
- API accepts old calls but falls back to default judge
- Existing roasts in database unaffected
- No data migration needed

## üöÄ Quick Start (If You're In a Hurry)

**Minimum steps to deploy:**

1. **Configure voice IDs in Vercel** (5 variables - see Step 1 above)
2. **Push to preview:** `git push origin HEAD:deploy/judge-update`
3. **Test preview deployment** (basic smoke test)
4. **Merge to main:** Merge via GitHub or command line
5. **Monitor production** for first hour

## üÜò Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Q: Voice playback not working?**
A: Check voice IDs are configured in Vercel. See `ENV_SETUP_JUDGE_UPDATE.md`

**Q: Wrong judge responding?**
A: Check browser console for errors. Verify API receiving correct judge name.

**Q: Tone matrix behaving oddly?**
A: Clear browser cache. Check if dividers are visible.

**Q: Build failing?**
A: Already tested - build is successful. If issues persist, check Vercel logs.

### Rollback

If critical issues in production:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find previous working deployment
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"

Or revert via git:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## ‚ú® You're All Set!

The implementation is complete and ready to deploy. Follow the steps above and you'll have the new judge system and improved tone matrix live in production.

**Estimated time to deploy:** 30-60 minutes (including testing)
