### Voice Synthesis (if ElevenLabs configured):
1. Submit an idea

3. Click it
4. Audio should play

**If voice doesn't work:**
- Check `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set in Vercel

## 🔍 Database Verification (Optional)

**Check in Supabase:**

1. **Table Editor → roasts:**
   - Should see your test submissions
   - `user_id` can be NULL (anonymous) or UUID (authenticated)

2. **Table Editor → leaderboard:**
   - Should auto-populate from roasts table
   - Verify scores match

3. **Authentication → Users:**
   - Should see test user created in Test 2
